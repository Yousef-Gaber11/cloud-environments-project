- **SQLite**: The database used in this project. It comes pre-installed with Python.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yousef-Gaber11/cloud-environments-project.git
   cd cloud-environments-project/src
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   The project uses the following Python packages:

   - `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
   - `sqlite3` (comes pre-installed with Python)
   - `faker` (for generating fake data, optional)

   To install the required packages, run:

   ```bash
   pip install faker
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   - Run the `schema.sql` script to create the necessary tables in the SQLite database:

     ```bash
     sqlite3 bookstore.db < schema.sql
     ```

   - Optionally, you can populate the database with fake data using the `script.py` file:

     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```
